# PHONEPE_PULSEDATA_VISUALIZATION-EXPLORATION

About the project Phonepe pulse data visualization and exploration: This project mainly focuses on fetching a large amout of data from a Github repository and visualizing it. The collected data is stored in POSTRES(sql database) for better categorisation and easier assessibilty of data. Using Streamlit, the collected data is user interfaced with regarding to particular query they choose. The dashboard will display the data in an interactive manner, with atleast 10 dropdown options.This solution is expected to be clear, secure, efficient and user-friendly. 

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

PLOTLY: It is a library required to represent data graphically and for visualizing geostatical data in form of live map representation. 

PANDAS: Pandas library is used to convert the unstructured data in the form of dataframes(tables) in python itlsef. This sturctured data can furthur transferred to SQL.
